    - This project used Google App Script as a way to create both those 20 folders and the 20 spreadsheets inside of them making 400 spreadsheets at once

## What I'm working on

    - This project that I'm working on is allowing me to review mathmatical concepts in code.

## This Class so far for me 
- 8/22 - Getting the Cloud Ubuntu Service
> Installed packages, clone git repository
- 8/23 - Running the terminal for Linux Shell and Bash, crashed and burned
> Overloaded with work from other classes
- 8/24 - Blogging on this page, getting linux shell and bash to work.
> Blogging despite a few of it's setbacks, was fun once I got in the hang of it.
